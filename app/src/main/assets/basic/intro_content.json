      "There are many examples of successful musicians without formal music training, including Jimi Hendrix, Tom Morello and even The Beatles, though all of these musicians will have some understanding of music theory.

      "A good understanding of music theory can open up a whole new series of possibilities when it comes to writing, can drastically reduce time in terms of writing and can even make music documentation more efficient. For example, having a knowledge of scales rather than working from ear means you know the exact sequence of notes to play and will allow you to implement new scales or modes easily.",
      "Being able to record this in \"sheet music\" means that your music can be easily understood by other musicians."
