		"So, how do we know how many beats are in a bar? This is where the time signature comes in. The bottom number of the time signature tells us the length of each beat. Itâ€™s best to think of this as a fraction of a semibreve - remember this is a note lasting 4 beats - so a 1 on the bottom means a whole semibreve, a 2 means a minim, a 4 means a crotchet, and an 8 means a quaver."
