There are also notes known as flats represented by a stylised lower case b, but just knowning sharps is okay for now. Just know that C# is what we call a \"half step\" up from C and D is a \"full step\" up from C. You may have noticed that B and E do not have sharps. Again, understanding this right now is currently not important but it is important to remember that they do not have sharps. To remember this, try and say to yourself \"Big Elephants don't have sharps\""
