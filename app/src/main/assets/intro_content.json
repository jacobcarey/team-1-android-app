    "content": "According to the Oxford English Dictionary music theory is \"The study of the theoretical aspects of music and its notation, especially as opposed to actual performance.\" There are many examples of successful musicians without formal music training such as Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Tom Morello, etc. But all of these musicians will have some understanding of music theory. Hendrix was notorious for his use and manipulation of the \"pentatonic scale\" which you will learn about later on."

    "title": "Why is music theory important?",
    "content": "Music theory can open up a whole new series of possibilities when it comes to writing, can drastically reduce time in terms of writing and can even make documentation more efficient. For example, having a knowledge of scales rather than working from ear means you know the exact sequence of notes to play and will aloow you to implement new scales or modes easily. Being able to record this in \"sheet music\" means that your music can be easily understood by other musicians."
