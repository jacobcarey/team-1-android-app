		"Using the example of C major’s primary triad, CEG (we worked this out in the Chord Construction lesson), we would play this on a piano with C being the lowest note, then E in the middle, and G as the highest note. If we apply the 1st inversion, the chord would then become EGC - E as the lowest note, then G, then C. Notice we’re still using the same notes, but in a different order. Applying the inversion again gives us the 2nd inversion: GCE, and applying an inversion one more takes us back to the root arrangement, CEG."
