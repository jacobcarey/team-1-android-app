		"To test this out, let’s construct the primary triad of C major. We know the root (not the tonic!) is C, as it’s the name of the scale. The third note in C major (the mediant) is E, and the dominant is G. Therefore, the primary triad of C major is CEG. If you don’t know where we got these notes, check back through the scale degrees topic (don’t worry, it can take a while to memorise all the degrees!)."
