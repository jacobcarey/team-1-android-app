		"Now, an important difference to remember when using chords is the first note isn’t called the tonic, we call it the  <b> root </b>. This is a small difference but it’s helpful to differentiate between, for example, the scale of C major and a chord of C major."

		"The primary triad is made up of 3 notes (tri means 3). Now, when we say notes, we don’t mean specific notes but instead degrees on a scale - namely, the <b> tonic </b>, the <b> mediant </b>, and the <b> dominant </b>, or degrees 1, 3 and 5. "

		"To test this out, let’s construct the primary triad of C major. We know the <b> root </b> (not the tonic!) is C, as it’s the name of the scale. The third note in C major (the <b> mediant </b>) is E, and the  <b> dominant </b> is G. Therefore, the primary triad of C major is CEG. If you don’t know where we got these notes, check back through the scale degrees topic (don’t worry, it can take a while to memorise all the degrees!)."
