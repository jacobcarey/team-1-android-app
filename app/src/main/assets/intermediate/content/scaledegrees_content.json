Note that, since a scale always ends on the note it started on, the last note in the scale is also called the tonic - usually referred to as the ‘upper tonic’."

		"The fourth degree is called the subdominant, as it is below (‘sub’ in Latin) the dominant.",

If you listen to a major scale being played, you’ll hear the seventh note feels like it ‘leads’ into the eighth note, the upper tonic. Otherwise, in a minor scale, the seventh degree is called the ‘subtonic’ - it’s one note below the tonic."
