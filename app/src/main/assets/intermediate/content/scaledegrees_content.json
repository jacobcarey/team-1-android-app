Note that, since a scale always ends on the note it started on, the last note in the scale is also called the tonic - usually referred to as the <b>‘upper tonic’</b>."

If you listen to a major scale being played, you’ll hear the seventh note feels like it ‘leads’ into the eighth note, the <b>upper tonic</b>. Otherwise, in a minor scale, the seventh degree is called the ‘subtonic’ - it’s one note below the tonic."
